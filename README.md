# About my ant colony project

That project is a python graphic app. Around a thousand ants spawn on the window, and every one chooses another ant that it has to follow forever. 

It's all, but it produces beautiful patterns, because the ants drop pheromones behind them (I will try to release a usable version, if I can)

There a few different options. For example : it's posible to make the ants follow the user's mouse, instead of following each other. It looks a bit like a drawing app, as the ants are like a trail fading slowly.
